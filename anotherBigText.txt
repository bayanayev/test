Came in with all this money
I know that they all want it
But you’re the one who gets it
Should’ve paid more attention
I should be paying more attention to you(x4)
Shit, smoke and mirrors, dollar bills
Flexin' for no reason, get it how you live
Crack a seal, bottle poppin' on another level
Red light special, she ain’t selfish, workin' with no discretion
Twistin', turnin', my mind blown and her mind gone
She slow rollin', ain’t no ho in her time zone
Face right, stage lights turn her out
Act like she the only one in here
That can twerk for real and that’s without a doubt
Like damn, DJ, run that back
I think that was her song, and she don’t know how to act
Like damn, all night I been with it
All night she been gettin' it, all night she been winnin'
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
